## My Vision

Welcome to **The Soul Train**, I started Soul Train to help people like me who just got into yoga, pilates, and mindfulness. I share all kinds of info â€“ different yoga and pilates styles, meditation tips, and even cool things like sound healing. I created this site to showcase what I can do for businesses in the yoga industry, offering ideas and resources to support growth and success. This is important to me, and I'm thrilled to share my insights in a creative and meaningful way.

Following the correct structure provided by the LoveRunning Project inout media by code institute but appyling it to my soundheaing section- ensureing i was following the right path and covering all bases, ensuring it worked by running this through on different browsers and passing through the W3C validator ensuring there were no errors. Also testing on different browsers and devices to ensure this pulled through on all.

## Unfixed Errors

**Issue #1:** With the support and guidance with the communities on slack and from tutors at code institute providing my with all information on how to adjust the images on multi sized screens to fit in the containers. However, on smaller screens these images do present stretched.

**Issue #2:** Hidden checkboxes and labels for the gallery filter and accordion were inaccessible via keyboard due to the use of `display: none;`. Used for the navigation, including the icons, such as, â˜°, which I found from Microsoft word keyboard.
